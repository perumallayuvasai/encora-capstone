# 🛍️ Clothes Ecommerce Platform (Microservices Architecture)

A robust, event-driven e-commerce application built using a Microservices architecture. This project features a Spring Boot backend, a React frontend, real-time notifications via WebSockets, and asynchronous communication using Apache Kafka.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Microservices Architecture**: Decomposed into domain-specific services (Auth, Product, Order, Cart).
* **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point with JWT validation via gRPC.
* **Event-Driven Orders**: Asynchronous order processing and stock reservation using Kafka.
* **Real-Time Notifications**: WebSocket server pushes order status updates to the frontend.
* **Security**: Role-based access control (Admin/User), JWT Authentication, and Secure Cookies.
* **Frontend**: Modern React UI with Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and TanStack Query.
* **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 integration for product image storage.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
Start the required infrastructure (Kafka and Zookeeper/KRaft) using Docker Compose.

```bash
cd encora-capstone-main/infra
docker-compose up -d
```

Access Kafka UI at http://localhost:8080

### 2. Build Shared Libraries
The backend services rely on a shared library (shared-events) for DTOs and Proto files. This must be built first.

```bash
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/shared-events
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

### 3. Backend Setup
Since the project uses a mix of Gradle and Maven, follow the instructions for each service.

Environment Variables: For the Product Service, ensure you have AWS S3 credentials configured in application.yml or passed as environment variables:

* app.aws.s3.access-key-id
* app.aws.s3.secret-access-key
* app.aws.s3.bucket-name
* app.aws.s3.region

#### Running Gradle Services (Gateway, Auth, Product):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Auth Service
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/auth-service
./gradlew bootRun

# Terminal 2: Product Service
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/product-service
./gradlew bootRun

# Terminal 3: API Gateway
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/api-gateway
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Running Maven Services (Order, ShoppingCart):

```bash
# Terminal 4: Order Service
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/orderservice
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Terminal 5: Shopping Cart
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/shoppingcart
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Running WebSocket Server:

```bash
# Terminal 6: WebSocket
cd encora-capstone-main/backend/websocket
npm install
npm start
```

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Terminal 7: Frontend
cd encora-capstone-main/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the application at http://localhost:5173.

### 📜 API Documentation
Swagger UI is available via the API Gateway aggregation or individual services:

* API Gateway Swagger: http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html
* Auth Service: http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui.html
* Product Service: http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui.html
* Order Service: http://localhost:8086/swagger-ui.html

### 🧪 Testing

#### Backend
Run unit tests for individual services:

```bash
# Gradle
./gradlew test

# Maven
./mvnw test
```

#### Frontend
Linting is configured via ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### 🔄 Event Flow Example: Placing an Order

1. **Frontend**: User clicks "Buy Now". Request sent to Order Service.

2. **Order Service**: Sends a ProductCheckEvent to Kafka topic product-check-event.

3. **Product Service**: Consumes event, verifies stock, reduces inventory, and sends PlaceOrderEvent (Success/Fail) to place-order-event-topic.

4. **Order Service**: Consumes response. If success, saves order to DB. Sends OrderPlacedNotificationEvent to order-notification-topic.

5. **WebSocket Service**: Consumes notification from Kafka and pushes JSON message to the connected Frontend client via WebSocket.

6. **Frontend**: Displays a Toast notification confirming the order.
